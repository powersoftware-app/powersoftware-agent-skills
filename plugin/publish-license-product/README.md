# PowerSoftware Publish License Product — Qoder Plugin

Qoder-native plugin that packages the **`publish-license-product`** Agent Skill. It teaches an AI coding agent how to publish a license-enabled software product end-to-end on [PowerSoftware](https://www.powersoftware.app) / [幂栈网](https://www.powersoftware.cn).

## What this plugin does

Given a target product spec (JSON), the skill guides the agent through:

1. **User registration** on PowerSoftware (email verification code).
2. **Partner application** with a **mandatory human review gate** — the platform only injects the `DEVELOPER` role at login when the operator approves (`auditStatus === PASS`), so the skill pauses here and cannot bypass it.
3. **Re-login** to pick up the newly granted `DEVELOPER` role.
4. **Asset upload** — cover image, 3–20 detail images, and installer/archive; each goes through `checkFileExists → getPreSignedUrl → PUT` and returns the `objectName` used inside the product payload.
5. **Product submission** to `/product/submit`, with strict schema validation for `TRIAL_FIRST` (先用后付) vs `PAY_FIRST` (先付后用) sales models and edition price ordering.
6. **Return the `productUniqueCode`** (产品唯一编码) — the publish response now includes it; the skill prints it and records it to `ps-product.json` in the workspace, to be wired into the client license integration (see the companion `integrate-license` skill).

Ships with dependency-free Node 18+ scripts — **no `npm install` needed**.

Nothing from the source skill was omitted.

## Install

**Option A — one-line installer from the source repo (recommended):**

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/powersoftware-app/powersoftware-agent-skills/main/install.sh) qoder publish-license-product
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/powersoftware-app/powersoftware-agent-skills/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Option B — drop this plugin folder into a Qoder project:**

Copy the entire `publish-license-product/` (this folder) into your Qoder plugin directory or reference it in your project's plugin manifest; Qoder reads `.qoder-plugin/plugin.json` at the plugin root.

## Setup the skill needs

Before first use, edit `skills/publish-license-product/scripts/config.local.json` (copied from `config.example.json`):

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://www.powersoftware.app/frontApi",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

- `baseUrl` defaults to the overseas prod site `https://www.powersoftware.app/frontApi` (the platform's primary site). Turnstile on login/registration is currently disabled server-side, so scripted flows work directly.
- If a `captcha required` error ever reappears (Turnstile re-enabled), switch `baseUrl` to the CN site `https://www.powersoftware.cn/frontApi` — login/registration there skip Turnstile by design — or run the first login interactively in a browser and reuse the session.
- `config.local.json` and `.ps-session.json` are gitignored. **Never commit credentials or session cookies.**

## Human-review gate (by design)

The partner application step **cannot** be automated past human approval. The `apply-partner.mjs` script:

1. Submits your partner profile via `/developer/save`.
2. Prints a large `⛔ HUMAN GATE` block telling you to wait for an operator.
3. Requires you to re-run `login.mjs` after approval to pick up the `DEVELOPER` role before `publish.mjs` will succeed.

This mirrors the platform's real security model — the skill intentionally does not try to bypass it.

## Validation

- `.qoder-plugin/plugin.json` declares only components that exist (`skills: "./skills/"`, `logo: "./assets/avatar.svg"`).
- Skill frontmatter contains non-empty `name` and `description`.
- All Node scripts pass `node --check` (verified in upstream repo before packaging).
- No `.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX/`, `settings.local.json`, or non-Qoder manifest directories are shipped.
